//A method that does the jarvis algorithm. Takes a set of points  and number of points
//in this set that are valid, find the points in this set and add them to convexHull
//@param points, the set of points, a subset of these points will be the convex hull
//@param numPoints, the number of points in points that are valid
//@param convexHull, this will be manipualted from empty to containing the complex hull
